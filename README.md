# Progressive-Budget

  ## Description 

  As a user, I can add my daily transactions and keep track of my weekly budget. I can add and subtract transactions daily to make sure that all my transactions are registered. I can also add my transactions offline using indexedDB. Once back online, the transactions are then registered again in my mongoDB database.
